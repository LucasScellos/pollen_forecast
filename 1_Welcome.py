    ### üí° Why I Created This Project  
    I, along with my family and friends, suffer from pollen allergies, making it incredibly difficult to track 
    and anticipate high pollen days. The available tools were either inaccurate or lacked real-time forecasting, 
    making allergy management a challenge. This project was built to **help people like us prepare for allergy season**, 
    especially as **spring approaches**, so we can take precautions in advance.
    
    *This is a personal project by [Lucas Scellos](https://lucasscellos.github.io), built during a week-end.
